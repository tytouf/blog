The new year arrived and as usual it is the time of the year where one promises
oneself to do better this year than the year before. Taking resolution and
keeping them during the year is one of the hardest exercise. I tend not to take
resolutions for that reason but this year is different. This year I decided to
make only one promise and that is to "Talk less, (and) Make more!".

A happy new year to everyone and let's make a ton of stuff in 2014!
